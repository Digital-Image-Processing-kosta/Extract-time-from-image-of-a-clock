# Extract time from image of a clock
Function **extract_time** extracts the minutes and hours.<br />
Function **extract_time_bonus** extracts seconds if the needle exists, if not, outputs -1.

# IMPLEMENTATION
Input images are converted from RGB to grayscale, because knowledge of the color is redundant. Than the images are filtered with Gaussian filter in order to remove some artifacts and noise and to make gradients of the seconds needle smaller than the gradients of hours needle. 
The main problem is how to determine of all of the edges, extracted by [Canny edge detection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)(you can cehck out my Matlab implemenation from scratch [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)), which edges belong to needles. To make this possible we will only observe the middle part of the images. That is the part where we possibly only have needles edges.
So the Canny edge detection algorithm is applied only on the crooped part that contains 25% of the dimensions around the middle pixel of the images:

# TEST 
Run the **main.m** to test the functions on 12 images.

# NOTE
The hyperparameters in Hough's transformation are tuned for Matlab 2017.
